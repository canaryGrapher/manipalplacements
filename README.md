## Installation
Refer to the [example.env.local](https://github.com/canaryGrapher/manipalplacements/blob/main/example.env.local) file for setting up **.env.local** for your project.
Firebase details are not required if you do not want to include push notification feature. This is not required for local setup.
1. Clone the repo on your local system
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install` commands in the the root of your project. Make sure that you are not using yarn version 2.x.x or Berry, because as of September 12, 2021, typescript does not support plug-n-play. 
3. Make sure that you have set up the environment variables properly in the `.env.local` file in the root directory.
4. Run the project using the `npm run dev`
